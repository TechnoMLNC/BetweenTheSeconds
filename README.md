# BetweenTheSeconds
This is a team project (3 Person), the storyline and motivation are in development but the essential concept is there.
The Concept is the player running through a large set of courses, levels, or passages where the obstacles/challenges of traveling through these environments are the blockades that can be avoided if the player "time Switches".
The player can time switch at any game point, Past <-> Present. 
My part is helping design, test, and code many of the game's features and aspects.
